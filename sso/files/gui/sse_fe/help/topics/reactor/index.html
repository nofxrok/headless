                           <p class="p">Salt version 0.11.0 introduced the reactor system. The premise behind the
                              reactor system is that with Salt's events and the ability to execute commands,
                              a logic engine could be put in place to allow events to trigger actions, or
                              more accurately, reactions.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="p">This system binds sls files to event tags on the master. These sls files then
                              define reactions. This means that the reactor system has two parts. First, the
                              reactor option needs to be set in the master configuration file.  The reactor
                              option allows for event tags to be associated with sls reaction files. Second,
                              these reaction files use highdata (like the state system) to define reactions
                              to be executed.
                           </p>

                              <p class="p">A basic understanding of the event system is required to understand reactors.
                                 The event system is a local ZeroMQ PUB interface which fires salt events. This
                                 event bus is an open system used for sending information notifying Salt and
                                 other systems about operations.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">The event system fires events with a very specific criteria. Every event has a
                                 <strong class="ph b">tag</strong>. Event tags allow for fast top level filtering of events. In
                                 addition to the tag, each event has a data structure. This data structure is a
                                 dict, which contains information about the event.
                              </p>

                                 API and the runner system.  In this example, a command is published to the
