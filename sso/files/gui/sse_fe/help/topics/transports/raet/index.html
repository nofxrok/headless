                              <p class="p">The RAET transport is in very early development, it is functional but no
                                 promises are yet made as to its reliability or security.
                                 As for reliability and security, the encryption used has been audited and
                                 our tests show that raet is reliable. With this said we are still conducting
                                 more security audits and pushing the reliability.
                                 This document outlines the encryption used in RAET

                           <p class="p">The Reliable Asynchronous Event Transport, or RAET, is an alternative transport
                              medium developed specifically with Salt in mind. It has been developed to
                              allow queuing to happen up on the application layer and comes with socket
                              layer encryption. It also abstracts a great deal of control over the socket
                              layer and makes it easy to bubble up errors and exceptions.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="p">RAET also offers very powerful message routing capabilities, allowing for
                              messages to be routed between processes on a single machine all the way up to
                              processes on multiple machines. Messages can also be restricted, allowing
                              processes to be sent messages of specific types from specific sources
                              allowing for trust to be established.

                              <h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using RAET in Salt</h2>
                              <p class="p">Using RAET in Salt is easy, the main difference is that the core dependencies
                                 change, instead of needing pycrypto, M2Crypto, ZeroMQ, and PYZMQ, the packages
                                 libsodium, libnacl, ioflo, and raet are required. Encryption is handled very cleanly
                                 by libnacl, while the queueing and flow control is handled by
                                 ioflo. Distribution packages are forthcoming, but libsodium can be easily
                                 installed from source, or many distributions do ship packages for it.
                                 The libnacl and ioflo packages can be easily installed from pypi, distribution
                                 packages are in the works.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Once the new deps are installed the 2014.7 release or higher of Salt needs to
                                 be installed.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Once installed, modify the configuration files for the minion and master to
                                 set the transport to raet:
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p"><tt class="ph tt">/etc/salt/master</tt>:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-yaml">transport: raet</pre>
                              <p class="p"><tt class="ph tt">/etc/salt/minion</tt>:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-yaml">transport: raet</pre>
                              <p class="p">Now start salt as it would normally be started, the minion will connect to the
                                 master and share long term keys, which can then in turn be managed via
                                 salt-key. Remote execution and salt states will function in the same way as
                                 with Salt over ZeroMQ.
                              </p>

                              <p class="p">The 2014.7 release of RAET is not complete! The Syndic and Multi Master have
                                 not been completed yet and these are slated for completion in the 2015.2.0
                                 release.

                              <p class="p">Also, Salt-Raet allows for more control over the client but these hooks have
                                 not been implemented yet, thereforre the client still uses the same system
                                 as the ZeroMQ client. This means that the extra reliability that RAET exposes
                                 has not yet been implemented in the CLI client.

                              <p class="p">Why make an alternative transport for Salt? There are many reasons, but the
                                 primary motivation came from customer requests, many large companies came with
                                 requests to run Salt over an alternative transport, the reasoning was varied,
                                 from performance and scaling improvements to licensing concerns. These
                                 customers have partnered with SaltStack to make RAET a reality.

                              <p class="p">RAET has been designed to allow salt to have greater communication
                                 capabilities. It has been designed to allow for development into features
                                 which out ZeroMQ topologies can't match.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Many of the proposed features are still under development and will be
                                 announced as they enter proof of concept phases, but these features include
                                 <span class="keyword title_reference">salt-fuse</span> - a filesystem over salt, <span class="keyword title_reference">salt-vt</span> - a parallel api driven shell
                                 over the salt transport and many others.

                              <p class="p">RAET is reliable, hence the name (Reliable Asynchronous Event Transport).</p>
                              
                              <p class="p">The concern posed by some over RAET reliability is based on the fact that
                                 RAET uses UDP instead of TCP and UDP does not have built in reliability.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">RAET itself implements the needed reliability layers that are not natively
                                 present in UDP, this allows RAET to dynamically optimize packet delivery
                                 in a way that keeps it both reliable and asynchronous.

                                 general sense, the ZeroMQ constructs are not reproduced in RAET, but they are
                                 instead implemented in such a way that is specific to Salt's needs.
