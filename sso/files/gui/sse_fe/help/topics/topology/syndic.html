                              of Salt command topologies. A basic Salt setup has a Salt Master commanding a
                              group of Salt Minions. The Syndic interface is a special passthrough
                              minion, it is run on a master and connects to another master, then the master
                              that the Syndic minion is listening to can control the minions attached to
                              the master running the syndic.

                              supposing the use of any single topology, but to allow a more flexible method
                              of controlling many systems.

                                 below the syndic(s), the CLI requires a short wait time in order to allow the
                                 syndic(s) to gather responses from their minions. This value is defined in the
                                 syndic_wait` and has a default of five seconds.
