                              private cloud vms to be managed directly with Salt. This system is generally
                              referred to as <strong class="ph b">Salt Virt</strong>.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="p">The Salt Virt system already exists and is installed within Salt itself, this
                              means that beside setting up Salt, no additional salt code needs to be
                              deployed.

                           <p class="p">The main goal of Salt Virt is to facilitate a very fast and simple cloud. The
                              cloud that can scale and fully featured. Salt Virt comes with the
                              ability to set up and manage complex virtual machine networking, powerful
                              image, and disk management, as well as virtual machine migration with and without
                              shared storage.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="p">This means that Salt Virt can be used to create a cloud from a blade center
                              and a SAN, but can also create a cloud out of a swarm of Linux Desktops
                              without a single shared storage system. Salt Virt can make clouds from
                              truly commodity hardware, but can also stand up the power of specialized
                              hardware as well.

                              <p class="p">One of the challenges of deploying a libvirt based cloud is the distribution
                                 of libvirt certificates. These certificates allow for virtual machine
                                 migration. Salt comes with a system used to auto deploy these certificates.
                                 Salt manages the signing authority key and generates keys for libvirt clients
                                 on the master, signs them with the certificate authority and uses pillar to
                                 distribute them. This is managed via the <tt class="ph tt">libvirt</tt> state. Simply execute this
                                 formula on the minion to ensure that the certificate is in place and up to
                                 date:

                              <p class="p">With hypervisors set up and virtual machine images ready, Salt can start
                                 issuing cloud commands.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Start by running a Salt Virt hypervisor info command:</p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-bash">salt-run virt.hyper_info</pre>
                              <p class="p">This will query what the running hypervisor stats are and display information
                                 for all configured hypervisors. This command will also validate that the
                                 hypervisors are properly configured.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Now that hypervisors are available a virtual machine can be provisioned. The
                                 <tt class="ph tt">virt.init</tt> routine will create a new virtual machine:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-bash">salt-run virt.init centos1 2 512 salt://centos.img</pre>
                              <p class="p">This command assumes that the CentOS virtual machine image is sitting in the
                                 root of the Salt fileserver. Salt Virt will now select a hypervisor to deploy
                                 the new virtual machine on and copy the virtual machine image down to the
                                 hypervisor.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Once the VM image has been copied down the new virtual machine will be seeded.
                                 Seeding the VMs involves setting pre-authenticated Salt keys on the new VM and
                                 if needed, will install the Salt Minion on the new VM before it is started.
                              </p>
                              
                              <aside class="note "><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span><span class="title">Note:</span> 
                                 <p class="p">The biggest bottleneck in starting VMs is when the Salt Minion needs to be
                                    installed. Making sure that the source VM images already have Salt
                                    installed will GREATLY speed up virtual machine deployment.
                                 </p>

                              <p class="p">Now that the new VM has been prepared, it can be seen via the <tt class="ph tt">virt.query</tt>
                                 command:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-bash">salt-run virt.query</pre>
                              <p class="p">This command will return data about all of the hypervisors and respective
                                 virtual machines.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Now that the new VM is booted it should have contacted the Salt Master, a
                                 <tt class="ph tt">test.ping</tt> will reveal if the new VM is running.

                                 the libvirt state in the above formula makes migration possible.

                              <p class="p">A few things need to be available to support migration. Many operating systems
                                 turn on firewalls when originally set up, the firewall needs to be opened up
                                 to allow for libvirt and kvm to cross communicate and execution migration
                                 routines. On Red Hat based hypervisors in particular port 16514 needs to be
                                 opened on hypervisors:

                              <p class="p">Salt also needs an additional flag to be turned on as well. The <tt class="ph tt">virt.tunnel</tt>
                                 option needs to be turned on. This flag tells Salt to run migrations securely
                                 via the libvirt TLS tunnel and to use port 16514. Without <tt class="ph tt">virt.tunnel</tt> libvirt
                                 tries to bind to random ports when running migrations. To turn on <tt class="ph tt">virt.tunnel</tt>
                                 simple apply it to the master config file:
