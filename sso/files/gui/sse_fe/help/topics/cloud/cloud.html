                              modules inside saltcloud exist in the <tt class="ph tt">salt/cloud/clouds</tt> directory of the
                              salt source.

                           <p class="p">There are two basic types of cloud modules. If a cloud provider is supported by
                              libcloud, then using it is the fastest route to getting a module written. The
                              Apache Libcloud project is located at:

                           <p class="p">Not every cloud provider is supported by libcloud. Additionally, not every
                              feature in a supported cloud provider is necessary supported by libcloud. In
                              either of these cases, a module can be created which does not rely on libcloud.

                                 upon execution. Most often, it uses <tt class="ph tt">get_configured_provider()</tt> to determine
                                 if the necessary configuration has been set up. It may also check for necessary
                                 imports, to decide whether to load the module. In most cases, it will return a

                                 filename, then that name should be returned instead of <tt class="ph tt">True</tt>. An example of
                                 this may be seen in the Azure module:

                              <p class="p">Writing a cloud module based on libcloud has two major advantages. First of all,
                                 much of the work has already been done by the libcloud project. Second, most of
                                 the functions necessary to Salt have already been added to the Salt Cloud
                                 project.

                              <p class="p">The most important function that does need to be manually written is the
                                 <tt class="ph tt">create()</tt> function. This is what is used to request a virtual machine to be
                                 created by the cloud provider, wait for it to become available, and then
                                 (optionally) log in and install Salt on it.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">A good example to follow for writing a cloud provider module based on libcloud
                                 is the module provided for Linode:

                                 It is tagged as <tt class="ph tt">salt/cloud/&lt;vm name&gt;/requesting</tt>. The payload contains most
                                 or all of the parameters that will be sent to the cloud provider. Any private

                                 at this point, and should be generated, even if the cloud provider does not
                                 currently support Windows. This will save time in the future if the provider
                                 does eventually decide to support Windows.
