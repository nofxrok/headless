                           <p class="p">One of the most powerful features of the Salt framework is the Event Reactor.
                              As the Reactor was in development, Salt Cloud was regularly updated to take
                              advantage of the Reactor upon completion. As such, various aspects of both the
                              creation and destruction of instances with Salt Cloud fire events to the Salt
                              Master, which can be used by the Event Reactor.
                           </p>

                              <h2 class="title sectiontitle">Event Structure</h2>
                              <p class="p">As of this writing, all events in Salt Cloud have a tag, which includes the ID
                                 of the instance being managed, and a payload which describes the task that is
                                 currently being handled. A Salt Cloud tag looks like:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-yaml">salt/cloud/&lt;minion_id&gt;/&lt;task&gt;</pre>
                              <p class="p">For instance, the first event fired when creating an instance named <tt class="ph tt">web1</tt>
                                 would look like:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-yaml">salt/cloud/web1/creating</pre>
                              <p class="p">Assuming this instance is using the <tt class="ph tt">ec2-centos</tt> profile, which is in turn
                                 using the <tt class="ph tt">ec2-config</tt> provider, the payload for this tag would look like:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-python">{'name': 'web1',

                              <p class="p">When an instance is created in Salt Cloud, whether by map, profile, or directly
                                 through an API, a minimum of five events are normally fired. More may be
                                 available, depending upon the cloud provider being used. Some of the common
                                 events are described below.
                              </p>

                                 includes:

                              <p class="p">Salt Cloud is about to make a request to the cloud provider to create an
                                 instance. At this point, all of the variables required to make the request have
                                 been gathered, and the payload of the event will reflect those variables which
                                 do not normally pose a security risk. What is returned here is dependent upon
                                 the cloud provider. Some common variables are:

                                 configured via the master configuration file. Normally this will will be a YAML
                                 file located at <tt class="ph tt">/etc/salt/master</tt>. Additionally, master configuration items

                                 may be best to create a single configuration file, which contains only Event
                                 Reactor configuration, at <tt class="ph tt">/etc/salt/master.d/reactor</tt>.

                                 fired when a cloud instance is destroyed.

                              <p class="p">Reactor <tt class="ph tt">sls</tt> files follow a similar format to other <tt class="ph tt">sls</tt> files in
                                 Salt. By default they are written in YAML and can be templated using Jinja, but
                                 since they are processed through Salt's rendering system, any available
                                 renderer (JSON, Mako, Cheetah, etc.) can be used.

                              <p class="p">The declaration ID in this example is <tt class="ph tt">new_instance_alert</tt>. The function

                                 specifies that an execution module and function will be called, in this case,

                              <p class="p">When Salt Cloud creates an instance, by default it will install the Salt Minion
                                 onto the instance, along with any specified minion configuration, and
                                 automatically accept that minion's keys on the master. One of the configuration
                                 options that can be specified is <tt class="ph tt">startup_states</tt>, which is commonly set to
                                 <tt class="ph tt">highstate</tt>. This will tell the minion to immediately apply a highstate, as
                                 soon as it is able to do so.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">This can present a problem with some system images on some cloud providers. For
                                 instance, Salt Cloud can be configured to log in as either the <tt class="ph tt">root</tt> user, or
                                 a user with <tt class="ph tt">sudo</tt> access. While some providers commonly use images that
                                 lock out remote <tt class="ph tt">root</tt> access and require a user with <tt class="ph tt">sudo</tt> privileges to
                                 log in (notably EC2, with their <tt class="ph tt">ec2-user</tt> login), most cloud providers fall
                                 back to <tt class="ph tt">root</tt> as the default login on all images, including for operating
                                 systems (such as Ubuntu) which normally disallow remote <tt class="ph tt">root</tt> login.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">For users of these operating systems, it is understandable that a highstate
                                 would include configuration to block remote <tt class="ph tt">root</tt> logins again. However,
                                 Salt Cloud may not have finished cleaning up its deployment files by the time
                                 the minion process has started, and kicked off a highstate run. Users have
                                 reported errors from Salt Cloud getting locked out while trying to clean up
                                 after itself.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">The goal of a startup state may be achieved using the Event Reactor. Because a
                                 minion fires an event when it is able to receive commands, this event can
                                 effectively be used inside the reactor system instead. The following will point
                                 the reactor system to the right <tt class="ph tt">sls</tt> file:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-yaml">reactor:
  - 'salt/cloud/*/created':
    - '/srv/reactor/startup_highstate.sls'</pre>
                              <p class="p">And the following <tt class="ph tt">sls</tt> file will start a highstate run on the target minion:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-yaml"># /srv/reactor/startup_highstate.sls
reactor_highstate:
  cmd.state.highstate:
    - tgt: {{ data['name'] }}</pre>
                              <p class="p">Because this event will not be fired until Salt Cloud has cleaned up after
                                 itself, the highstate run will not step on Salt Cloud's toes. And because every
                                 file on the minion is configurable, including <tt class="ph tt">/etc/salt/minion</tt>, the
                                 <tt class="ph tt">startup_states</tt> can still be configured for future minion restarts, if
                                 desired.
