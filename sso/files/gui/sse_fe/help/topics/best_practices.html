                              <p class="p">When structuring Salt States and Formulas it is important to begin with the
                                 directory structure. A proper directory structure clearly defines the
                                 functionality of each state to the user via visual inspection of the state's
                                 name.
                              </p>

                                 it is clear to see the benefits to the end-user when reviewing a sample of the
                                 available states:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-bash">/srv/salt/mysql/files/
/srv/salt/mysql/client.sls
/srv/salt/mysql/map.jinja
/srv/salt/mysql/python.sls
/srv/salt/mysql/server.sls</pre>
                              <p class="p">This directory structure would lead to these states being referenced in a top
                                 file in the following way:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-yaml">base:

  'db*':
    - mysql.server</pre>
                              <p class="p">This clear definition ensures that the user is properly informed of what each
                                 state will do.
                              </p>

                              <p class="p">The usage of a clear top-level directory as well as properly named states
                                 reduces the overall complexity and leads a user to both understand what will

                                 is why it is important to understand that the top file for pillar is not used
                                 for variable definitions.

                                 creates a consistent understanding throughout our Salt environment. Users can

                                 that sane defaults should exist in the event a variable is not properly
                                 defined. Looking at several examples shows how these different items can
                                 lead to extensive flexibility.

                              <p class="p">Ensuring that states are modular is one of the key concepts to understand
                                 within Salt. When creating a state a user must consider how many times the
                                 state could be re-used, and what it relies on to operate. Below are several
                                 examples which will iteratively explain how a user can go from a state which
                                 is not very modular to one that is:
                              </p>

                              <p class="p">The example above is probably the worst-case scenario when writing a state.
                                 There is a clear lack of focus by naming both the pkg/service, and managed
                                 file directly as the state ID. This would lead to changing multiple requires
                                 within this state, as well as others that may depend upon the state.

                                 then suddenly it's a custom package. Now changes need to be made in multiple
                                 locations which increases the complexity and leads to a more error prone
                                 configuration.

                                 which lead to a lack of modularity. The first of these problems is the usage
                                 of static values for items such as the name of the service, the name of the
                                 managed file, and the source of the managed file. When these items are hard
                                 coded they become difficult to modify and the opportunity to make mistakes
                                 arises. It also leads to multiple edits that need to occur when changing
                                 these items (imagine if there were dozens of these occurrences throughout the
                                 state!). There is also still the concern of the configuration file data living
                                 in the same state as the service and package.

                                 be immediately visible.

                                 in this state. This  means that any minion will have a copy of this, and
                                 therefore the password which is a major security concern as minions may not
                                 be locked down as tightly as the master server.

                                 everyone has access to the states (or their repository), then they are able to
                                 review this password. Keeping your password data accessible by only a few
                                 users is critical for both security and peace of mind.

                                 it results in multiple changes needing to be made. This was discussed in the
                                 sections above but it is a critical idea to drive home. If states are not
                                 portable it may result in more work later!
