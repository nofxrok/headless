                                 management systems without sacrificing simplicity. This tutorial is made to
                                 help users understand in detail just how the order is defined for state
                                 executions in Salt.

                              <p class="p">To understand ordering in depth some very basic knowledge about the state
                                 compiler is very helpful. No need to worry though, this is very high level!

                              <h2 class="title sectiontitle">High Data and Low Data</h2>
                              <p class="p">When defining Salt Formulas in YAML the data that is being represented is
                                 referred to by the compiler as High Data. When the data is initially
                                 loaded into the compiler it is a single large python dictionary, this
                                 dictionary can be viewed raw by running:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-bash">salt '*' state.show_highstate</pre>
                              <p class="p">This "High Data" structure is then compiled down to "Low Data". The Low
                                 Data is what is matched up to create individual executions in Salt's
                                 configuration management system. The
                                 low data is an ordered list of single state calls to execute. Once the
                                 low data is compiled the evaluation order can be seen.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">The low data can be viewed by running:</p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-bash">salt '*' state.show_lowstate</pre>
                              <aside class="note "><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span><span class="title">Note:</span> 
                                 <p class="p">The state execution module contains MANY functions for evaluating the
                                    state system and is well worth a read! These routines can be very useful
                                    when debugging states or to help deepen one's understanding of Salt's
                                    state system.

                              <p class="p">The best practice in Salt is to choose a method and stick with it, official
                                 states are written using requisites for all associations since requisites
                                 create clean, traceable dependency trails and make for the most portable
                                 formulas. To accomplish something similar to how classical imperative
                                 systems function all requisites can be omitted and the <tt class="ph tt">failhard</tt> option
                                 then set to <span class="keyword title_reference">True</span> in the master configuration, this will stop all state runs at
                                 the first instance of a failure.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">In the end, using requisites creates very tight and fine grained states,
                                 not using requisites makes full sequence runs and while slightly easier
                                 to write, and gives much less control over the executions.
