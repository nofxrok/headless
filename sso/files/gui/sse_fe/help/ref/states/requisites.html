                              <p class="p">The Salt requisite system is used to create relationships between states. The
                                 core idea being that, when one state is dependent somehow on another, that
                                 inter-dependency can be easily defined.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Requisites come in two types: Direct requisites (such as <tt class="ph tt">require</tt>),
                                 and requisite_ins (such as <tt class="ph tt">require_in</tt>). The relationships are
                                 directional: a direct requisite requires something from another state.
                                 However, a requisite_in inserts a requisite into the targeted state pointing to
                                 the targeting state.  The following example demonstrates a direct requisite:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-yaml">vim:
  pkg.installed: []

/etc/vimrc:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://edit/vimrc
    - require:
      - pkg: vim</pre>
                              <p class="p">In the example above, the file <tt class="ph tt">/etc/vimrc</tt> depends on the vim package.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Requisite_in statements are the opposite. Instead of saying "I depend on
                                 something", requisite_ins say "Someone depends on me":
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-yaml">vim:
  pkg.installed:
    - require_in:
      - file: /etc/vimrc

/etc/vimrc:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://edit/vimrc</pre>
                              <p class="p">So here, with a requisite_in, the same thing is accomplished as in the first
                                 example, but the other way around. The vim package is saying "/etc/vimrc depends
                                 on me".  This will result in a <tt class="ph tt">require</tt> being inserted into the
                                 <tt class="ph tt">/etc/vimrc</tt> state which  targets the <tt class="ph tt">vim</tt> state.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">In the end, a single dependency map is created and everything is executed in a
                                 finite and predictable order.
                              </p>

                                    also have been matched if the <tt class="ph tt">/etc/vimrc</tt> state was written as follows:

                              <p class="p">There are six direct requisite statements that can be used in Salt:
                                 <tt class="ph tt">require</tt>, <tt class="ph tt">watch</tt>, <tt class="ph tt">prereq</tt>, <tt class="ph tt">use</tt>, <tt class="ph tt">onchanges</tt>, and <tt class="ph tt">onfail</tt>.
                                 Each direct requisite also has a corresponding requisite_in: <tt class="ph tt">require_in</tt>,
                                 <tt class="ph tt">watch_in</tt>, <tt class="ph tt">prereq_in</tt>, <tt class="ph tt">use_in</tt>, <tt class="ph tt">onchanges_in</tt>, and <tt class="ph tt">onfail_in</tt>.
                                 All of the requisites define specific relationships and always work with the
                                 dependency logic defined above.

                              <p class="p">The use of <tt class="ph tt">require</tt> demands that the dependent state executes before the
                                 depending state. The state containing the <tt class="ph tt">require</tt> requisite is defined as the
                                 depending state. The state specified in the <tt class="ph tt">require</tt> statement is defined as the
                                 dependent state. If the dependent state's execution succeeds, the depending state
                                 will then execute. If the dependent state's execution fails, the depending state
                                 will not execute. In the first example above, the file <tt class="ph tt">/etc/vimrc</tt> will only
                                 execute after the vim package is installed successfully.

                                 actually run. If the pre-requiring state executes successfully, the
