                                 caller and used to execute a single state function.

                                 is finite; this means that the order of execution can be ascertained with 100%
                                 certainty based on the order of the low state.

                              <p class="p">High data is the data structure represented in YAML via SLS files. The High
                                 data structure is created by merging the data components rendered inside sls
                                 files (or other render systems). The High data can be easily viewed by
                                 executing the <tt class="ph tt">state.show_highstate</tt> or <tt class="ph tt">state.show_sls</tt> functions. Since
                                 this data is a somewhat complex data structure, it may be easier to read using
                                 the json, yaml, or pprint outputters:

                                 is generated is optional and very flexible. The SLS layer allows for many
                                 mechanisms to be used to render sls data from files or to use the fileserver
                                 backend to generate sls and file data from external systems.

                                    single SLS was only constituted in a single file. Now the term
                                    "SLS Formula" better expresses how a compartmentalized SLS can be expressed
                                    in a much more dynamic way by combining pillar and other sources, and the
                                    SLS can be dynamically generated.
