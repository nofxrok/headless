                              <p class="p">HTTP Health Checks can be used as a means to toggle load-balancing across
                                 instance members, or to detect if an HTTP site is functioning.  A common
                                 use-case is to set up a health check URL and if you want to toggle traffic
                                 on/off to an instance, you can temporarily have it return a non-200 response.
                                 A non-200 response to the load-balancer's health check will keep the LB from
                                 sending any new traffic to the "down" instance.  Once the instance's
                                 health check URL beings returning 200-responses, the LB will again start to
                                 send traffic to it. Review Compute Engine's documentation for allowable
                                 parameters.  You can use the following salt-cloud functions to manage your
                                 HTTP health checks.
