                           <p class="p">The minion’s configuration file is typically found under /etc/salt/minion. In this
                              file, the
                              hostname or ip of the salt-master is defined (default is “salt”). The minion can connect
                              simultaneously to multiple masters. This is achieved by simply presenting the masters
                              as a list
                              in YAML (<a class="xref" href="http://www.yaml.org" target="_blank">www.yaml.org</a>)
                              formatting. So instead of Master: hostname it would look like the following example:
                           </p>

                              before the “-” and a single space between the “-” and the name or ip string. The minion
                              will
                              actively connect simultaneously to all masters.

                              native to
                              Salt. A possible solution for consideration is to place this file under management
                              by Salt. Since
                              all salt-commands are forked from the salt-minion and master processes, Salt can “salt”
                              itself.

                              If the key
                              has been accepted it will be moved to /etc/salt/pki/master. If a minion is trusted
                              by one master,
                              it will be important to replicate that trust across all masters. If the minion is
                              no longer
                              trusted by a master, that state must be replicated as well.

                           <p class="p">As of this writing, there are no mechanisms to replicate keys across salt-masters

                              future release of the SaltStack Enterprise console. As a workaround, using an external

                              or
                              stored as a YAML data structure on the master directly. In the case of external pillars,
                              the only
                              consideration would be replicating the salt master config (see Master Configuration).
                              In the case
                              of native pillars, they are typically found in flat files under /srv/pillar. 
                           </p>

                              Salt Master in
                              a DVCS. By placing the pillar in a DVCS, you may take advantage of the distributed
                              architecture
                              of the system as well as obtain the additional benefits of version control.

                           <p class="p">Salt configuration data is typically stored in a YAML flat file called a Salt State.
                              The
                              directory structure containing Salt States is known as a “state tree” and typically
                              found under

                              salt-masters that are native to SaltStack. The recommended approach for most environments
                              is to
                              store the state files directly in the DVCS system.

                           <p class="p">In any highly available SaltStack implementation, you will have multiple salt-master
                              servers
                              with the exception of running salt in “masterless mode” which is rather uncommon.
                              In order to
                              maintain a central control point for all salt-masters, configuring a Salt Syndic is
                              desirable.
                              The syndic is very simple to configure, see docs.saltstack.com - salt syndic <a class="xref" href="http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/topology/syndic.html" target="_blank">http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/topology/syndic.html</a>.
                              Multiple syndics are not recommended as of this writing.

                              available (HA) solution with SaltStack. It is not the design of this document to identify

                              possible HA solution or architecture, nor is it to be entirely prescriptive on how
                              high-availability should be achieved within each consideration. We recommend working
                              closely with
                              SaltStack Professional Services to design a high-availability approach that is suitable
