                           <p class="p">Many of the most powerful and useful engineering solutions are founded on
                              simple principles. Salt States strive to do just that: K.I.S.S. (Keep It
                              Stupidly Simple)
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="p">The core of the Salt State system is the SLS, or <strong class="ph b">S</strong>a<strong class="ph b">L</strong>t
                              <strong class="ph b">S</strong>tate file. The SLS is a representation of the state in which
                              a system should be in, and is set up to contain this data in a simple format.
                              This is often called configuration management.

                              <p class="p">Before delving into the particulars, it will help to understand that the SLS
                                 file is just a data structure under the hood. While understanding that the SLS
                                 is just a data structure isn't critical for understanding and making use of
                                 Salt States, it should help bolster knowledge of where the real power is.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">SLS files are therefore, in reality, just <a class="xref" href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping" target="_blank">dictionaries</a>, <a class="xref" href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq" target="_blank">lists</a>, <a class="xref" href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq" target="_blank">strings</a>, and <a class="xref" href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric" target="_blank">numbers</a>.
                                 By using this approach Salt can be much more flexible. As one writes more state
                                 files, it becomes clearer exactly what is being written. The result is a system
                                 that is easy to understand, yet grows with the needs of the admin or developer.

                                 need to be added. The Apache configuration file will most likely be managed,
                                 and a user and group may need to be set up.
                              </p>

                              <p class="p">This SLS data greatly extends the first example, and includes a config file,

                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Adding more states is easy, since the new user and group states are under
                                 the Apache ID, the user and group will be the Apache user and group. The
                                 <tt class="ph tt">require</tt> statements will make sure that the user will only be made after
                                 the group, and that the group will be made only after the Apache package is
                                 installed.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Next, the <tt class="ph tt">require</tt> statement under service was changed to watch, and is
                                 now watching 3 states instead of just one. The watch statement does the same
                                 thing as require, making sure that the other states run before running the
                                 state with a watch, but it adds an extra component. The <tt class="ph tt">watch</tt> statement
                                 will run the state's watcher function for any changes to the watched states.
                                 So if the package was updated, the config file changed, or the user
                                 uid modified, then the service state's watcher will be run. The service
                                 state's watcher just restarts the service, so in this case, a change in the
                                 config file will also trigger a restart of the respective service.

                                 to learn and use. But the SLS files can be rendered from almost any imaginable
                                 medium, so long as a renderer module is provided.

                                 templating system, and then through the YAML parser. The benefit here is that

                              <h2 class="title sectiontitle">Introducing the Python, PyDSL, and the Pyobjects Renderers</h2>
                              <p class="p">Sometimes the chosen default renderer might not have enough logical power to
                                 accomplish the needed task. When this happens, the Python renderer can be
                                 used. Normally a YAML renderer should be used for the majority of SLS files,
                                 but an SLS file set to use another renderer can be easily added to the tree.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">This example shows a very basic Python SLS file:</p>
                              
                              <p class="p"><tt class="ph tt">python/django.sls:</tt></p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-python">#!py

def run():
    '''
    Install the django package
    '''
    return {'include': ['python'],
            'django': {'pkg': ['installed']}}</pre>
                              <p class="p">This is a very simple example; the first line has an SLS shebang that
                                 tells Salt to not use the default renderer, but to use the <tt class="ph tt">py</tt> renderer.
                                 Then the run function is defined, the return value from the run function
                                 must be a Salt friendly data structure, or better known as a Salt

                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Alternatively, using the

                                 renderer, the above example can be written more succinctly as:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-python">#!pydsl

include('python', delayed=True)
state('django').pkg.installed()</pre>
                              <p class="p">The 
                                 		
                                 			&nbsp;<a class="xref" href="../../ref/renderers/all/salt.renderers.pyobjects.html#salt-renderers-pyobjects">pyobjects</a> renderer
                                 provides an <a class="xref" href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" target="_blank">"Pythonic"</a> object based approach for building the state data.
                                 The above example could be written as:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-python">#!pyobjects

include('python')
Pkg.installed("django")</pre>
                              <p class="p">This Python examples would look like this if they were written in YAML:</p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-yaml">include:
  - python

django:
  pkg.installed</pre>
                              <p class="p">This example clearly illustrates that; one, using the YAML renderer by default
                                 is a wise decision and two, unbridled power can be obtained where needed by
                                 using a pure Python SLS.
                              </p>

                              <p class="p">Once the rules in an SLS are ready, they should be tested to ensure they
                                 work properly. To invoke these rules, simply execute
                                 <tt class="ph tt">salt '*' state.highstate</tt> on the command line. If you get back only
                                 hostnames with a <tt class="ph tt">:</tt> after, but no return, chances are there is a problem with
                                 one or more of the sls files. On the minion, use the <tt class="ph tt">salt-call</tt> command:
                                 <tt class="ph tt">salt-call state.highstate -l debug</tt> to examine the output for errors.
                                 This should help troubleshoot the issue. The minions can also be started in
                                 the foreground in debug mode: <tt class="ph tt">salt-minion -l debug</tt>.
