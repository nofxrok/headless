                              <p class="p">The default behaviour of a salt-minion is to connect to a master and accept
                                 the masters public key. With each publication, the master sends his public-key
                                 for the minion to check and if this public-key ever changes, the minion
                                 complains and exits. Practically this means, that there can only be a single
                                 master at any given time.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Would it not be much nicer, if the minion could have any number of masters
                                 (1:n) and jump to the next master if its current master died because of a
                                 network or hardware failure?
                              </p>

                                 <p class="p">There is also a MultiMaster-Tutorial with a different approach and topology
                                    than this one, that might also suite your needs or might even be better suited

                              <p class="p">It is also desirable, to add some sort of authenticity-check to the very first
                                 public key a minion receives from a master. Currently a minions takes the
                                 first masters public key for granted.

                              <p class="p">Setup the master to sign the public key it sends to the minions and enable the
                                 minions to verify this signature for authenticity.

                              <p class="p">For signing to work, both master and minion must have the signing and/or
                                 verification settings enabled. If the master signs the public key but the
                                 minion does not verify it, the minion will complain and exit. The same
                                 happens, when the master does not sign but the minion tries to verify.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">The easiest way to have the master sign its public key is to set</p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-yaml">master_sign_pubkey: True</pre>
                              <p class="p">After restarting the salt-master service, the master will automatically
                                 generate a new key-pair
                              </p>

                              <p class="p">The master will then generate that key-pair upon restart and use it for
                                 creating the public keys signature attached to the auth-reply.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">The computation is done for every auth-request of a minion. If many minions
                                 auth very often, it is advised to use conf_master:<span class="keyword title_reference">master_pubkey_signature</span>
                                 and conf_master:<span class="keyword title_reference">master_use_pubkey_signature</span> settings described below.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">If multiple masters are in use and should sign their auth-replies, the signing
                                 key-pair master_sign.* has to be copied to each master. Otherwise a minion
                                 will fail to verify the masters public when connecting to a different master
                                 than it did initially. That is because the public keys signature was created
                                 with a different signing key-pair.
