                              <p class="p">This guide is aimed at developers who wish to run Salt in a virtual machine.
                                 The official (Linux) walkthrough can be found

                           <p class="p">Because Salt has a lot of dependencies that are not built in Mac OS X, we will
                              use Homebrew to install Salt. Homebrew is a package manager for Mac, it's
                              great, use it (for this tutorial at least!). Some people spend a lot of time
                              installing libs by hand to better understand dependencies, and then realize how
                              useful a package manager is once they're configuring a brand new machine and
                              have to do it all over again. It also lets you <em class="ph i">uninstall</em> things easily.

                              <p class="p">Brew is a Ruby program (Ruby is installed by default with your Mac). Brew
                                 downloads, compiles, and links software. The linking phase is when compiled
                                 software is deployed on your machine. It may conflict with manually
                                 installed software, especially in the /usr/local directory. It's ok,
                                 remove the manually installed version then refresh the link by typing
                                 <tt class="ph tt">brew link 'packageName'</tt>. Brew has a <tt class="ph tt">brew doctor</tt> command that can
                                 help you troubleshoot. It's a great command, use it often. Brew requires
                                 xcode command line tools. When you run brew the first time it asks you to
                                 install them if they're not already on your system. Brew installs
                                 software in /usr/local/bin (system bins are in /usr/bin). In order to use
                                 those bins you need your $PATH to search there first. Brew tells you if
                                 your $PATH needs to be fixed.

                              tutorial we're going to use VirtualBox. In addition to virtualBox, we will use

                                 know Salt lets you configure and run commands on hordes of servers easily.
                                 Here's a brief overview of a Salt cluster:

                                    <p class="p">Salt works by having a "master" server sending commands to one or multiple
                                       "minion" servers <span class="keyword footnote_reference">1</span>. The master server is the "command center". It is
                                       going to be the place where you store your configuration files, aka: "which
                                       server is the db, which is the web server, and what libraries and software
                                       they should have installed". The minions receive orders from the master.
                                       Minions are the servers actually performing work for your business.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="p">Salt has two types of configuration files:</p>
                                    
                                    <p class="p">1. the "salt communication channels" or "meta"  or "config" configuration
                                       files (not official names): one for the master (usually is /etc/salt/master
                                       , <strong class="ph b">on the master server</strong>), and one for minions (default is
                                       /etc/salt/minion or /etc/salt/minion.conf, <strong class="ph b">on the minion servers</strong>). Those
                                       files are used to determine things like the Salt Master IP, port, Salt
                                       folder locations, etc.. If these are configured incorrectly, your minions
                                       will probably be unable to receive orders from the master, or the master
                                       will not know which software a given minion should install.

                                       official name): these are configuration files, ending with ".sls" extension,
                                       that describe which software should run on which server, along with
                                       particular configuration properties for the software that is being
                                       installed. These files should be created in the /srv/salt folder by default,
                                       but their location can be changed using ... /etc/salt/master configuration file!

                                    it also contains some Salt configuration. More on that in step 3. Also
                                    note that all configuration files are YAML files. So indentation matters.

                                 this requires accepting the minion key every time the minion is destroyed or
                                 created (which could be quite often). A better way is to create those keys in
                                 advance, feed them to the minion, and authorize them once.
