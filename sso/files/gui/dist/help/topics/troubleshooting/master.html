                                 that your minion has connected, it could very well be a firewall interfering
                                 with the connection. See our

                              <p class="p">The salt-master needs at least 2 sockets per host that connects to it, one for
                                 the Publisher and one for response port. Thus, large installations may, upon
                                 scaling up the number of minions accessing a given master, encounter:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-bash">12:45:29,289 [salt.master    ][INFO    ] Starting Salt worker process 38
Too many open files
sock != -1 (tcp_listener.cpp:335)</pre>
                              <p class="p">The solution to this would be to check the number of files allowed to be
                                 opened by the user running salt-master (root by default):
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-bash">[root@salt-master ~]# ulimit -n
1024</pre>
                              <p class="p">If this value is not equal to at least twice the number of minions, then it
                                 will need to be raised. For example, in an environment with 1800 minions, the
                                 <tt class="ph tt">nofile</tt> limit should be set to no less than 3600. This can be done by
                                 creating the file <tt class="ph tt">/etc/security/limits.d/99-salt.conf</tt>, with the following
                                 contents:
                              </p>

                              <p class="p">Replace <tt class="ph tt">root</tt> with the user under which the master runs, if different.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">If your master does not have an <tt class="ph tt">/etc/security/limits.d</tt> directory, the lines

                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">As with any change to resource limits, it is best to stay logged into your
                                 current shell and open another shell to run <tt class="ph tt">ulimit -n</tt> again and verify that
                                 the changes were applied correctly. Additionally, if your master is running
                                 upstart, it may be necessary to specify the <tt class="ph tt">nofile</tt> limit in
                                 <tt class="ph tt">/etc/default/salt-master</tt> if upstart isn't respecting your resource limits:

                              <p class="p">Using the <tt class="ph tt">-c</tt> option with the Salt command modifies the configuration
                                 directory. When the configuration file is read it will still base data off of
                                 the <tt class="ph tt">root_dir</tt> setting. This can result in unintended behavior if you are
                                 expecting files such as <tt class="ph tt">/etc/salt/pki</tt> to be pulled from the location
                                 specified with <tt class="ph tt">-c</tt>. Modify the <tt class="ph tt">root_dir</tt> setting to address this
                                 behavior.

                              <h2 class="title sectiontitle">Salt Master Doesn't Return Anything While Running jobs</h2>
                              <p class="p">When a command being run via Salt takes a very long time to return
                                 (package installations, certain scripts, etc.) the master may drop you back
                                 to the shell. In most situations the job is still running but Salt has
                                 exceeded the set timeout before returning. Querying the job queue will
                                 provide the data of the job but is inconvenient. This can be resolved by
                                 either manually using the <tt class="ph tt">-t</tt> option to set a longer timeout when running
                                 commands (by default it is 5 seconds) or by modifying the master
                                 configuration file: <tt class="ph tt">/etc/salt/master</tt> and setting the <tt class="ph tt">timeout</tt> value to
                                 change the default timeout for all commands, and then restarting the
                                 salt-master service.
