                                 of new Salt modules. Since then, many applications have been developed for
                                 running any Salt module locally on a minion. These range from the original
                                 intent of salt-call, development assistance, to gathering more verbose output
                                 from calls like

                              <h2 class="title sectiontitle">Multiprocessing in Execution Modules</h2>
                              <p class="p">As is outlined in github issue #6300, Salt cannot use python's multiprocessing
                                 pipes and queues from execution modules. Multiprocessing from the execution
                                 modules is perfectly viable, it is just necessary to use Salt's event system
                                 to communicate back with the process.

                              <p class="p">The reason for this difficulty is that python attempts to pickle all objects in
                                 memory when communicating, and it cannot pickle function objects. Since the
                                 Salt loader system creates and manages function objects this causes the pickle
                                 operation to fail.

                              <p class="p">When a command being run via Salt takes a very long time to return
                                 (package installations, certain scripts, etc.) the minion may drop you back
                                 to the shell. In most situations the job is still running but Salt has
                                 exceeded the set timeout before returning. Querying the job queue will
                                 provide the data of the job but is inconvenient. This can be resolved by
                                 either manually using the <tt class="ph tt">-t</tt> option to set a longer timeout when running
                                 commands (by default it is 5 seconds) or by modifying the minion
                                 configuration file: <tt class="ph tt">/etc/salt/minion</tt> and setting the <tt class="ph tt">timeout</tt> value to
                                 change the default timeout for all commands, and then restarting the
