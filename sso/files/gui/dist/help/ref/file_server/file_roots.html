                                 manages large files quickly and with little overhead, and has been optimized
                                 to handle small files in an extremely efficient manner.

                                 files can be allocated within many root directories and accessed by
                                 specifying both the file path and the environment to search. The
                                 individual environments can span across multiple directory roots
                                 to create overlays and to allow for files to be organized in many flexible
                                 ways.

                                 isolation of environments by the engineer using Salt, but also allows
                                 for information to be used in multiple environments.
