                              <p class="p">The way in which configuration management systems are executed is a hotly
                                 debated topic in the configuration management world. Two
                                 major philosophies exist on the subject, to either execute in an imperative
                                 fashion where things are executed in the order in which they are defined, or
                                 in a declarative fashion where dependencies need to be mapped between objects.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Imperative ordering is finite and generally considered easier to write, but
                                 declarative ordering is much more powerful and flexible but generally considered
                                 more difficult to create.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Salt has been created to get the best of both worlds. States are evaluated in
                                 a finite order, which guarantees that states are always executed in the same
                                 order, and the states runtime is declarative, making Salt fully aware of
                                 dependencies via the <span class="keyword title_reference">requisite</span> system.

                              <h2 class="title sectiontitle">State Auto Ordering</h2><pre class="pre codeblock">versionadded: 0.17.0</pre>
                              <p class="p">Salt always executes states in a finite manner, meaning that they will always
                                 execute in the same order regardless of the system that is executing them.
                                 But in Salt 0.17.0, the <tt class="ph tt">state_auto_order</tt> option was added. This option
                                 makes states get evaluated in the order in which they are defined in sls
                                 files.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">The evaluation order makes it easy to know what order the states will be
                                 executed in, but it is important to note that the requisite system will
                                 override the ordering defined in the files, and the <tt class="ph tt">order</tt> option described
                                 below will also override the order in which states are defined in sls files.

                                 <p class="p">This document represents behavior exhibited by Salt requisites as of
                                    version 0.9.7 of Salt.
                                 </p>

                              <p class="p">Often when setting up states any single action will require or depend on
                                 another action. Salt allows for the building of relationships between states
                                 with requisite statements. A requisite statement ensures that the named state
                                 is evaluated before the state requiring it. There are three types of requisite
                                 statements in Salt, <strong class="ph b">require</strong>, <strong class="ph b">watch</strong>, and <strong class="ph b">prereq</strong>.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">These requisite statements are applied to a specific state declaration:</p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-yaml">httpd:
  pkg.installed: []
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    - source: salt://httpd/httpd.conf
    - require:
      - pkg: httpd</pre>
                              <p class="p">In this example, the <strong class="ph b">require</strong> requisite is used to declare that the file
                                 /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf should only be set up if the pkg state executes
                                 successfully.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">The requisite system works by finding the states that are required and
                                 executing them before the state that requires them. Then the required states
                                 can be evaluated to see if they have executed correctly.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">Require statements can refer to any state defined in Salt. The basic examples
                                 are <span class="keyword title_reference">pkg</span>, <span class="keyword title_reference">service</span>, and <span class="keyword title_reference">file</span>, but any used state can be referenced.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="p">In addition to state declarations such as pkg, file, etc., <strong class="ph b">sls</strong> type requisites
                                 are also recognized, and essentially allow 'chaining' of states. This provides a
                                 mechanism to ensure the proper sequence for complex state formulas, especially when
                                 the discrete states are split or groups into separate sls files:
                              </p>
                              <pre class="pre codeblock language-yaml">include:
  - network

httpd:
  pkg.installed: []
  service.running:
    - require:
      - pkg: httpd
      - sls: network</pre>
                              <p class="p">In this example, the httpd service running state will not be applied
                                 (i.e., the httpd service will not be started) unless both the httpd package is
                                 installed AND the network state is satisfied.
                              </p>

                                    Therefore, if using the <tt class="ph tt">pkgs</tt> or <tt class="ph tt">sources</tt> argument to install
                                    a list of packages in a pkg state, it's important to note that it is
                                    impossible to match an individual package in the list, since all packages
                                    are installed as a single state.
