                          <p>SaltStack is a new approach to infrastructure management. SaltStack is simple enough to get running in minutes, scalable enough to manage tens of thousands of servers, and fast enough to communicate with them in seconds.</p>

                          <p>Learn more at <a href="http://saltstack.com" target="_blank">saltstack.com.</a></p>
                          <h4 class="title sectiontitle">We Love All of You</h4>

                          <p>Or at least all of your management approaches. When enthusiasts talk about the 'best' management approach, they are usually right about a particular approach being the best for <i>their</i> needs. But what about <i>your</i> needs?</p>

                              <p>SaltStack is focused on creating the best set of management tools available anywhere, and then providing as many ways as we can think of to let you use them. No agent? No server? No problem.</p>



                          <!--<h4 class="title sectiontitle">You can do <i>that</i> with SaltStack?</h4>

                          <p>This is something we hear often at SaltStack, and it is at the heart of Salt flexibility.  </p>-->

                      <p></p>

                      <p>This quick start guide walks you through the basic steps to get SaltStack up and running. You'll learn how to:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Install SaltStack</li>
                          <li>Remotely execute commands</li>
                          <li>Manage software and system configurations</li>
                      </ul>

                          <p>Before we start, we've included a few things we think you should know about SaltStack's flexible approach to management. (If this doesn't interest you, feel free to jump straight into the guide.)</p>

                      <h3>SaltStack Flexibility</h3>
                      <p>Every management tool and their Git forks claim to be flexible, but when we say flexible at SaltStack, we mean <b>entire-management-approach flexible</b>.</p>

                          <p>SaltStack can be configured to follow a variety of systems management models:</p>


                      <ul>
                          <li><b>Agent and Server</b>
                          <li><b>Agent-only</b></li>
                          <li><b>Server-only</b></li>
                          <li>Any or all of the above together</li>
                      </ul>

                              <h4>Agent and Server</h4>
                              <p>The standard model for configuration management. A management server sends commands and configurations to agents running on large numbers of systems, and results are returned to the server.</p>


                              <h4>Agent-only</h4>
                             <p>If you have avoided management tools because you don't want to set up all of that "extra stuff", this is likely the model for you. Salt agents can perform management tasks with or without the involvement of a server.

                                 <p>The best thing about this model is that it is already built-in; if you don't want to use a management server, you simply don't set one up. You can move back and forth between this model and the Agent and Server model, or use them both together.</p>




                          <h4>Server-only</h4>
                              <p>Salt commands can be executed on remote systems using SSH instead of the Salt agent. Configure all of your web servers using the Salt agent, but perform ad hoc management tasks on your database servers over SSH. It is completely up to you.</p>


                      <h3>No Size Fits All</h3>

                      <p>In this guide, multiple approaches are often presented to perform the same task. These different approaches are presented together because they can be used together. When you see a tab titled "Agent and Server", "Agent-only", or "Server-only", it shows how to use SaltStack with each management approach.</p>

                      <p>Now on with the guide.</p>
